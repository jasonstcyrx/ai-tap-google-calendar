Note:
Requires authorization.

Updates metadata for a calendar. This method supports patch semantics. Note that each patch request consumes three quota units; prefer using a get followed by an update. The field values you specify replace the existing values. Fields that you don't specify in the request remain unchanged. Array fields, if specified, overwrite the existing arrays; this discards any previous array elements.
