      Path parameters
    
      
        calendarId
        string
        
          Calendar identifier. To retrieve calendar IDs call the calendarList.list method. If you want to access the primary calendar of the currently logged in user, use the "primary" keyword.


        
      
    
      Optional query parameters
    
      
        conferenceDataVersion
        integer
        
          Version number of conference data supported by the API client. Version 0 assumes no conference data support and ignores conference data in the event's body. Version 1 enables support for copying of ConferenceData as well as for creating new conferences using the createRequest field of conferenceData. The default is 0.
          Acceptable values are 0 to 1, inclusive.


        
      
      
        maxAttendees
        integer
        
          The maximum number of attendees to include in the response. If there are more than the specified number of attendees, only the participant is returned. Optional.


        
      
      
        sendNotifications
        boolean
        
          Deprecated. Please use sendUpdates instead.Whether to send notifications about the creation of the new event. Note that some emails might still be sent even if you set the value to false. The default is false.


        
      
      
        sendUpdates
        string
        
          Whether to send notifications about the creation of the new event. Note that some emails might still be sent. The default is false.

          Acceptable values are:
          
            "all": Notifications are sent to all guests.
            
            "externalOnly": Notifications are sent to non-Google Calendar guests only.
            
            "none": No notifications are sent. Warning: Using the value none can have significant adverse effects, including events not syncing to external calendars or events being lost altogether for some users. For calendar migration tasks, consider using the events.import method instead.
            
          

        
      
      
        supportsAttachments
        boolean

        id
        string
        Opaque identifier of the event. When creating new single or recurring events, you can specify their IDs. Provided IDs must follow these rules:  characters allowed in the ID are those used in base32hex encoding, i.e. lowercase letters a-v and digits 0-9, see section 3.1.2 in RFC2938 the length of the ID must be between 5 and 1024 characters the ID must be unique per calendar  Due to the globally distributed nature of the system, we cannot guarantee that ID collisions will be detected at event creation time. To minimize the risk of collisions we recommend using an established UUID algorithm such as one described in RFC4122.  If you do not specify an ID, it will be automatically generated by the server.  Note that the icalUID and the id are not identical and only one of them should be supplied at event creation time. One difference in their semantics is that in recurring events, all occurrences of one event have different ids while they all share the same icalUIDs.

        start.timeZone
        string
        The time zone in which the time is specified. (Formatted as an IANA Time Zone Database name, e.g. "Europe/Zurich".) For recurring events this field is required and specifies the time zone in which the recurrence is expanded. For single events this field is optional and indicates a custom time zone for the event start/end.
        
          writable
        
      
      
        status
        string
        Status of the event. Optional. Possible values are:  "confirmed" - The event is confirmed. This is the default status. "tentative" - The event is tentatively confirmed. "cancelled" - The event is cancelled (deleted). The list method returns cancelled events only on incremental sync (when syncToken or updatedMin are specified) or if the showDeleted flag is set to true. The get method always returns them.  A cancelled status represents two different states depending on the event type:  Cancelled exceptions of an uncancelled recurring event indicate that this instance should no longer be presented to the user. Clients should store these events for the lifetime of the parent recurring event.  Cancelled exceptions are only guaranteed to have values for the id, recurringEventId and originalStartTime fields populated. The other fields might be empty.  All other cancelled events represent deleted events. Clients should remove their locally synced copies. Such cancelled events will eventually disappear, so do not rely on them being available indefinitely.  Deleted events are only guaranteed to have the id field populated.   On the organizer's calendar, cancelled events continue to expose event details (summary, location, etc.) so that they can be restored (undeleted). Similarly, the events to which the user was invited and that they manually removed continue to provide details. However, incremental sync requests with showDeleted set to false will not return these details.  If an event changes its organizer (for example via the move operation) and the original organizer is not on the attendee list, it will leave behind a cancelled event where only the id field is guaranteed to be populated.

        string
        Whether the event blocks time on the calendar. Optional. Possible values are:  "opaque" - Default value. The event does block time on the calendar. This is equivalent to setting Show me as to Busy in the Calendar UI. "transparent" - The event does not block time on the calendar. This is equivalent to setting Show me as to Available in the Calendar UI.
