Note:
Requires authorization.

Updates an event. This method supports patch semantics. Note that each patch request consumes three quota units; prefer using a get followed by an update. The field values you specify replace the existing values. Fields that you don't specify in the request remain unchanged. Array fields, if specified, overwrite the existing arrays; this discards any previous array elements.
Try it now.





  Request
  HTTP request
PATCH https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/calendars/calendarId/events/eventId

  Parameters
  
    
      
        Parameter name
        Value
        Description
      
    
    
    
      Path parameters
    
      
        calendarId
        string
        
          Calendar identifier. To retrieve calendar IDs call the calendarList.list method. If you want to access the primary calendar of the currently logged in user, use the "primary" keyword.


        
      
      
        eventId
        string
        
          Event identifier.


        
      
    
      Optional query parameters
    
      
        alwaysIncludeEmail
        boolean
        
          Deprecated and ignored. A value will always be returned in the email field for the organizer, creator and attendees, even if no real email address is available (i.e. a generated, non-working value will be provided).


        
      
      
        conferenceDataVersion
        integer
        
          Version number of conference data supported by the API client. Version 0 assumes no conference data support and ignores conference data in the event's body. Version 1 enables support for copying of ConferenceData as well as for creating new conferences using the createRequest field of conferenceData. The default is 0.
          Acceptable values are 0 to 1, inclusive.


        
      
      
        maxAttendees
        integer
        
          The maximum number of attendees to include in the response. If there are more than the specified number of attendees, only the participant is returned. Optional.


        
      
      
        sendNotifications
        boolean
        
          Deprecated. Please use sendUpdates instead.Whether to send notifications about the event update (for example, description changes, etc.). Note that some emails might still be sent even if you set the value to false. The default is false.


        
      
      
        sendUpdates
        string
        
          Guests who should receive notifications about the event update (for example, title changes, etc.).

          Acceptable values are:
          
            "all": Notifications are sent to all guests.
            
            "externalOnly": Notifications are sent to non-Google Calendar guests only.
            
            "none": No notifications are sent. For calendar migration tasks, consider using the Events.import method instead.
            
          

        
      
      
        supportsAttachments
        boolean
        
          Whether API client performing operation supports event attachments. Optional. The default is False.
