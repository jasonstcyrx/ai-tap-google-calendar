  Methods



  


      delete
      Deletes an access control rule.



      get
      Returns an access control rule.



      insert
      Creates an access control rule.



      list
      Returns the rules in the access control list for the calendar.



      patch
      Updates an access control rule. This method supports patch semantics. Note that each patch request consumes three quota units; prefer using a get followed by an update. The field values you specify replace the existing values. Fields that you don't specify in the request remain unchanged. Array fields, if specified, overwrite the existing arrays; this discards any previous array elements.



      update
      Updates an access control rule.



      watch
      Watch for changes to ACL resources.
