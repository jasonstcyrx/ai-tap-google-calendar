  Request
  HTTP request
GET https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/users/me/settings

  Parameters
  
    
      
        Parameter name
        Value
        Description
      
    
    
    
      Optional query parameters
    
      
        maxResults
        integer
        
          Maximum number of entries returned on one result page. By default the value is 100 entries. The page size can never be larger than 250 entries. Optional.


        
      
      
        pageToken
        string
        
          Token specifying which result page to return. Optional.


        
      
      
        syncToken
        string
        
          Token obtained from the nextSyncToken field returned on the last page of results from the previous list request. It makes the result of this list request contain only entries that have changed since then. If the syncToken expires, the server will respond with a 410 GONE response code and the client should clear its storage and perform a full synchronization without any syncToken. Learn more about incremental synchronization. Optional. The default is to return all entries.
