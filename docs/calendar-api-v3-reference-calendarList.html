  Methods



  


      delete
      Removes a calendar from the user's calendar list.



      get
      Returns a calendar from the user's calendar list.



      insert
      Inserts an existing calendar into the user's calendar list.



      list
      Returns the calendars on the user's calendar list.



      patch
      Updates an existing calendar on the user's calendar list. This method supports patch semantics. Note that each patch request consumes three quota units; prefer using a get followed by an update. The field values you specify replace the existing values. Fields that you don't specify in the request remain unchanged. Array fields, if specified, overwrite the existing arrays; this discards any previous array elements.



      update
      Updates an existing calendar on the user's calendar list.



      watch
      Watch for changes to CalendarList resources.
