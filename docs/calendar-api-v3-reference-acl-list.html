  Request
  HTTP request
GET https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/calendars/calendarId/acl

  Parameters
  
    
      
        Parameter name
        Value
        Description
      
    
    
    
      Path parameters
    
      
        calendarId
        string
        
          Calendar identifier. To retrieve calendar IDs call the calendarList.list method. If you want to access the primary calendar of the currently logged in user, use the "primary" keyword.


        
      
    
      Optional query parameters
    
      
        maxResults
        integer
        
          Maximum number of entries returned on one result page. By default the value is 100 entries. The page size can never be larger than 250 entries. Optional.


        
      
      
        pageToken
        string
        
          Token specifying which result page to return. Optional.


        
      
      
        showDeleted
        boolean
        
          Whether to include deleted ACLs in the result. Deleted ACLs are represented by role equal to "none". Deleted ACLs will always be included if syncToken is provided. Optional. The default is False.


        
      
      
        syncToken
        string
        
          Token obtained from the nextSyncToken field returned on the last page of results from the previous list request. It makes the result of this list request contain only entries that have changed since then. All entries deleted since the previous list request will always be in the result set and it is not allowed to set showDeleted to False. If the syncToken expires, the server will respond with a 410 GONE response code and the client should clear its storage and perform a full synchronization without any syncToken. Learn more about incremental synchronization.  Optional. The default is to return all entries.
