Note:
Requires authorization.

Imports an event. This operation is used to add a private copy of an existing event to a calendar. Only events with an eventType of default may be imported.Deprecated behavior: If a non-default event is imported, its type will be changed to default and any event-type-specific properties it may have will be dropped.
Try it now or see an example.

      Path parameters
    
      
        calendarId
        string
        
          Calendar identifier. To retrieve calendar IDs call the calendarList.list method. If you want to access the primary calendar of the currently logged in user, use the "primary" keyword.


        
      
    
      Optional query parameters
    
      
        conferenceDataVersion
        integer
        
          Version number of conference data supported by the API client. Version 0 assumes no conference data support and ignores conference data in the event's body. Version 1 enables support for copying of ConferenceData as well as for creating new conferences using the createRequest field of conferenceData. The default is 0.
          Acceptable values are 0 to 1, inclusive.


        
      
      
        supportsAttachments
        boolean
        
          Whether API client performing operation supports event attachments. Optional. The default is False.

  Request body




  In the request body, supply an Events resource with the following properties:
  
      
        
          Property name
          Value
          Description
          Notes
        
      
    
    
      Required Properties
    
      
        end
        nested object
        The (exclusive) end time of the event. For a recurring event, this is the end time of the first instance.
        
        
      
      
        iCalUID
        string
        Event unique identifier as defined in RFC5545. It is used to uniquely identify events accross calendaring systems and must be supplied when importing events via the import method.  Note that the iCalUID and the id are not identical and only one of them should be supplied at event creation time. One difference in their semantics is that in recurring events, all occurrences of one event have different ids while they all share the same iCalUIDs. To retrieve an event using its iCalUID, call the events.list method using the iCalUID parameter. To retrieve an event using its id, call the events.get method.
        
        
      
      
        start
        nested object
        The (inclusive) start time of the event. For a recurring event, this is the start time of the first instance.
        
        
      

    
      Optional Properties
    
      
        anyoneCanAddSelf

        The attendees of the event. See the Events with attendees guide for more information on scheduling events with other calendar users. Service accounts need to use domain-wide delegation of authority to populate the attendee list.

        attendeesOmitted
        boolean
        Whether attendees may have been omitted from the event's representation. When retrieving an event, this may be due to a restriction specified by the maxAttendee query parameter. When updating an event, this can be used to only update the participant's response. Optional. The default is False.

        start.timeZone
        string
        The time zone in which the time is specified. (Formatted as an IANA Time Zone Database name, e.g. "Europe/Zurich".) For recurring events this field is required and specifies the time zone in which the recurrence is expanded. For single events this field is optional and indicates a custom time zone for the event start/end.
        
          writable
        
      
      
        status
        string
        Status of the event. Optional. Possible values are:  "confirmed" - The event is confirmed. This is the default status. "tentative" - The event is tentatively confirmed. "cancelled" - The event is cancelled (deleted). The list method returns cancelled events only on incremental sync (when syncToken or updatedMin are specified) or if the showDeleted flag is set to true. The get method always returns them.  A cancelled status represents two different states depending on the event type:  Cancelled exceptions of an uncancelled recurring event indicate that this instance should no longer be presented to the user. Clients should store these events for the lifetime of the parent recurring event.  Cancelled exceptions are only guaranteed to have values for the id, recurringEventId and originalStartTime fields populated. The other fields might be empty.  All other cancelled events represent deleted events. Clients should remove their locally synced copies. Such cancelled events will eventually disappear, so do not rely on them being available indefinitely.  Deleted events are only guaranteed to have the id field populated.   On the organizer's calendar, cancelled events continue to expose event details (summary, location, etc.) so that they can be restored (undeleted). Similarly, the events to which the user was invited and that they manually removed continue to provide details. However, incremental sync requests with showDeleted set to false will not return these details.  If an event changes its organizer (for example via the move operation) and the original organizer is not on the attendee list, it will leave behind a cancelled event where only the id field is guaranteed to be populated.

        transparency
        string
        Whether the event blocks time on the calendar. Optional. Possible values are:  "opaque" - Default value. The event does block time on the calendar. This is equivalent to setting Show me as to Busy in the Calendar UI. "transparent" - The event does not block time on the calendar. This is equivalent to setting Show me as to Available in the Calendar UI. 
        
          writable
        
      
      
        visibility

"public" - The event is public and event details are visible to all readers of the calendar. "private" - The event is private and only event attendees may view event details. "confidential" - The event is private. This value is provided for compatibility reasons.
